# stock-analysis
## Overview of the Project
To analyze the daily performance of all the stocks.
## Results
From the analysis using the refractored code, it takes less than 1 seconds to analyze the daily performances of all the stocks in a year.
From this analysis, it can be deduced that, all the stocks except TERP experienced daily growth in year 2017. While only two stocks experience positive growth in 2018. Also, original script took about 0.5 seconds to run the analysis while the refactored script took about 0.1 seconds to run the analysis. Attached are the snapshot of the time taken to run the analysis by the refactored script ![VBA_Challeneg_2017.png](path/to/VBA_Challenge_2017.png),![VBA_Challeneg_2018.png](path/to/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)
## Summary
#### Advantage of using refractored code.
Refractored code takes into account all the tickers in each year. unlike the original code that can only analyse one ticker.
Refractor code takes lesser time than the original code  to run the analysis. This indicates that the refractored code is more efficient in analyzing.
#### Disadvantage of using refractored code.
Refractored code limit the user ability to run the code the way he or she would want it to be.
Refractored code require lot of deep understandimg of the VBA to be able to improve on the code given.
In general, only three lines of code are added to the original code and makes it more efficient.
